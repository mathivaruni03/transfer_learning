# transfer_learning
Transfer learning is a deep learning technique where a pre-trained model is adapted to a new but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, knowledge from an existing model (trained on a large dataset) is transferred to improve performance and reduce training time on a smaller dataset. 
This is widely used in image recognition, NLP, and other AI applications. 
Instead of training a model from scratch, a model trained on a large dataset is fine-tuned to improve performance on a smaller dataset. This reduces training time, requires less data, and often leads to better generalization.

Applications:
Image Classification – Using models like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet pre-trained on ImageNet.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Fine-tuning models like BERT, GPT, or T5 for text classification, translation, or sentiment analysis.
Speech Recognition – Adapting pre-trained audio models for voice-based applications.

Key Benefits:

Reduces Training Time: Utilizes pre-trained models, significantly decreasing computation costs.
Requires Less Data: Effective even with smaller datasets by leveraging knowledge from large-scale datasets.
Improves Performance: Often achieves better accuracy than training from scratch, especially for tasks with limited data.

Common Approaches

Feature Extraction: Uses a pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor. The last layer is replaced with a new classifier trained for the specific task.
Fine-Tuning: The pre-trained model is partially retrained, adjusting some layers while keeping others frozen to adapt to the new dataset.
Domain Adaptation: Modifies the model to work effectively across different but related datasets.

Getting Started

To implement transfer learning in Python using TensorFlow or PyTorch:

TensorFlow Example:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

base_model = keras.applications.VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
base_model.trainable = False
model = keras.Sequential([
    base_model,
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

PyTorch Example:
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 10)
